OLED oriented :
==============


Board Initialization;

Start with blue screen on OLED,
Allow toggling between display of 2 different patterns under control of slider switch



Note: 
More files than needed in /src (e.g. usb_xx) and /inc 
but kept to have same structure and contents of all "BringUp" directories
-- only main() is different and calls what needs to be
