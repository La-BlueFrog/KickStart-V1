TEST of STemWin GFX Library for OLED 
=====================================

Initialize Board
Initialize emWin


Define a "Memory Device" in emWin's terminology (ie a cache) and perform some drawing and text writing operations using emWin API.

The Cache must fit in 32K SRAM of STM32L1RC along with stack etc. so can't contain full screen.
Solution to address full screen can be to use "Banding" Memory Device.

REfer to emWin's user manual for API etc.
