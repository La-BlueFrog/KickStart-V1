============================

Basic sanity check of DataFlash (read ID) 
and allow user to launch bulk (ie. full chip) erase of data Flash if activating slider switch within 2sec of power on.

Activate USB: 
then connecting to module to USB Host (PC) should allow to store/retrive files to/from disk.
If not formatted yet, PC Host should (checked on W7) should propose to format drive in FAT(16).

USB handled by interrupts; run infinite loop flashing green LED in background.


NOTE: still somewhat unstable - under investigation.
